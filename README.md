# GAN MNIST Generator 🎨🤖

This project builds a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Python and Keras to generate handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 💡 What is this project?

Imagine teaching a robot to draw numbers!

- The **generator** is like an artist that tries to draw numbers.
- The **discriminator** is like a judge that checks if the drawing looks real.

Over time, the robot learns to draw digits that look like they were written by real humans!

## 📦 Tech Stack

## 🖼️ Output Samples

The model starts drawing noisy images, but as training continues, it generates realistic handwritten digits like:
